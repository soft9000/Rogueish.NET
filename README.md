# Rogueish.NET
My cross-platform, Object Oriented, "Roguelike Ruminations" / TUI for the .NET Core, as well as the classic CLR. -Destined to become an equally cross-platform "GuiTUI," as well.

I am particularly proud of the minimalist code of the "navigational computer" in this first release; only a very few lines (no need for slope calculations - single-axis point-trending worked better than LineDDA.)

p.s.
If you do not already know C# / .NET, then here is my related "no nonsense" training opportunity, **C# 1000:**:
